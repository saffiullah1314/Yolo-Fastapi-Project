# YOLOv8 Object Detection Project 🚀

Welcome to my **YOLOv8 Object Detection** project!  
This is a **full-stack AI application** capable of detecting objects in **images and videos** using the state-of-the-art **YOLOv8 deep learning model**.  
It combines **Python, FastAPI, OpenCV, HTML/CSS**, and provides a **web interface for real-time interaction**.

## Project Overview 🌟
This project detects multiple objects in **images or videos** and highlights them with **bounding boxes and labels**.  
It is designed for practical AI applications such as **surveillance, research, and automation**.

I have been working on **AI/ML for the past 6–7 months**, focusing on theory and understanding deep learning concepts.  
Now I am building **real-world projects** and plan to share advanced, heavy projects soon.

## Features ✨
- Detect objects in **images and videos**.
- **Real-time detection** with YOLOv8.
- **Backend API** using FastAPI for processing.
- **Frontend interface** for uploading files.
- Annotated output images/videos with **bounding boxes and confidence scores**.
- **Secure file handling and storage**.

---

## Technologies Used 🛠
- **Python** – Core programming for AI & backend.  
- **FastAPI** – Backend API server.  
- **OpenCV** – Image/video processing.  
- **YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)** – Object detection model.  
- **HTML/CSS + Jinja2** – Frontend interface.  
- **Pathlib & Shutil** – File handling in backend.  

---

## How It Works ⚙
1. User uploads image/video via frontend.  
2. FastAPI backend receives the file.  
3. YOLOv8 model predicts objects and confidence scores.  
4. Processed results are saved and returned to frontend.  
5. Frontend displays annotated images/videos.

## Backend Processing 🖥

### 1️⃣ File Handling
```python
from pathlib import Path
from fastapi import UploadFile

upload_path = Path("uploads") / file.filename
with open(upload_path, "wb") as f:
    f.write(file.file.read())

- Ensures secure file storage.

- Prevents overwriting or unsafe paths.


### 2️⃣ YOLOv8 Detection
```
from ultralytics import YOLO

model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")  # Load pre-trained model
results = model.predict(upload_path)
results.save("outputs/")

- Model predicts objects and confidence scores.

- Bounding boxes drawn automatically.

- Video frames are processed one by one.


### 3️⃣ Video Frame Processing

import cv2

cap = cv2.VideoCapture("uploads/video.mp4")
while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break
    results = model.predict(frame)
    for r in results:
        cv2.rectangle(frame, r.xyxy[0], r.xyxy[1], (0,255,0), 2)
cap.release()

- Extracts frames from video.

- Processes frame by frame.

- Saves annotated video at the end.



---

## Frontend 🎨

- HTML/CSS + Jinja2 templates for uploading files.

- Users can see processed images/videos without page reloads.


<form action="/upload" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    <input type="file" name="file" />
    <button type="submit">Upload</button>
</form>


---

## Dataset and Training 📂

- Uses pre-trained YOLOv8 model on COCO dataset (80 classes).

- No custom training required for this project.

- Confidence threshold set to optimize detection accuracy.

## Code Snippets 💻

FastAPI main.py sample:

from fastapi import FastAPI, UploadFile, File
from ultralytics import YOLO

app = FastAPI()
model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")

@app.post("/upload/")
async def upload_file(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    file_location = f"uploads/{file.filename}"
    with open(file_location, "wb+") as f:
        f.write(file.file.read())
    results = model.predict(file_location)
    results.save("outputs/")
    return {"file": f"Processed {file.filename}"}
